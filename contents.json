		You are standing in front of a mansion with your party members.
		People say it is haunted and tell each other not to get close.
		You are here in order to investigate the rumor.

		As you and your party get in, your hear the door being locked behind you.
		A voice echoes in the entrance hall.
		"Generally speaking, once people are told that they cannot do something,
		they start to crave it...
		Interestingly enough, this happens 
		even when they had no interest beforehand.
		I am sorry to tell you, but now you cannot get out."

		Each party member has a different expression on their face, 
		but no one says anything.
		The echoing voice continues.

		""Well, from that door at least.
		If you would like to get out, look for an exit elsewhere.
		Have fun exploring my 'haunted mansion,' good people."

		You look at the contractors of this job 
		who you met only a few hours before.
		They look back at you and each other.
		There are three doors other than the entrance door."
